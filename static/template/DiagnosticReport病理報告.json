The overlying skin shows focal increasing thickness. \r\nThe breast has been previously cut at the left outer upper quadrant areas, and it shows two nodular area (nodule 1 at retroareolar; nodule 2 at upper outer quadrant, near L/2/4 cm.\r\nThese area are irregular on margin, firm & grayish white with focal yellowish streaks on cut surface. \r\nThe deep margin is free from these lesions.\r\nSome lymph nodes are dissected out from the axillary fat.\r\nAlso submitted are two bottles of tissue, labeled as breast axillary level I, and breast axillary level II. \r\n\r\nRepresentative sections are taken and labeled as follows :\r\n1-4: nodule 1 at retroareolar;\r\n5: nipple;\r\n6,7: overlying skin near nodule 1;\r\n8-13: nodule 2 at upper outer quadrant;\r\n14: overlying skin near nodule 2;\r\n15: deep margin;\r\n16-20, A1-A6: axillary fat and dissected axillary LNs;\r\n21: level I LN;\r\n22: level II LN.\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIC FINDING:\r\nSections of both nodular lesions show foci of residual invasive ductal carcinoma, composed of tumor cells arranged in cords and files, embedded within a fibrotic background, compatible with treatment effect. Foci of ductal carcinoma in situ are also noted.\r\nThe largest diameter of the residual tumors are 1.1x1.0 cm in nodule 1 (section 1) and 1.1x0.9 cm in nodule 2 (section 8).\r\nThe deep margin, nipple and skin are free from tumors. The skin is fibrotic with irregular dermal collagen, while shows no evidence of tumor emboli.\r\nThe lymph nodes are free from metastasis and are mostly atrophic, while section 20 shows two axillary lymph nodes with necrosis and cholesterol cleft formation, compatible with previous metastasis with complete response.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathologists:黃OO/廖OO醫師 病解專醫字第5XX號"
